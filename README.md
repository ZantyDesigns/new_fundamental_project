## Project Brief
As a software developer, we have been assigned the task of planning and developing a fully functional web based application using (insert technologies). The app must be user friendly and provide security measures to ensure the user can access and use the application safely. The application must meet the requirements of CRUD and be stored on the cloud.

## Project Objectives
* Develop a responsive web-based application to view user selected mountain bike trails in the U.K.
* Create a secure database to store trail location data.
* Implement trail locations using Google Maps via Google API.
* Implement the ability for users to Create, Read, Update and Delete Trail locations.

## Project Outcome
* User can register an account with a username and password
* User can select and view trails and locations via Google Maps
* User can add new trail locations aswell as update current trails

## Project Management
